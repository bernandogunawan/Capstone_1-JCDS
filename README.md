Car data is stored as a dictionary:

```python
database = {
    "LICENSE_PLATE": ["License Plate", "Brand", "Model", "Fuel Type", "Price/Day", "Status", "Days Left"]
}
```

Two additional sets are used to track car availability:
- `available_keys`
- `not_available_keys`

- `tabulate` (for clean table display)

Install it using:
```bash
pip install tabulate
```

---

1. Make sure Python and `tabulate` are installed.
2. Run the script:
```bash
python Capstone_1.py
```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts in the terminal.
